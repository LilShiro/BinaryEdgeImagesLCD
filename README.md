## Loop Closure Detection for Binary Edge Images
This is a project which aims to do loop closure detection using only binary edge images as a source of input. Loop Closure Detection is the ability for a system to identify if it has revisited the same scene given a sequence of image inputs into the system. By being able to use such reduced features to perform reliable loop closure detection will ultimately be beneficial in building low-powered and efficient camera systems for robotics as we can parallalise computation on the vision chips and only send such reduced features to the device for further processing. One notable example is the BIT-VO system built on the SCAMP-5 device designed by Murai et al.

Through this research, we have shown that it is indeed possible to do effective loop closure detection with binary edge immages. We were able to produce reliable loop closures on a variety of data sets - Outdoor RGB image sequences from the New College / City Center dataset as well as a small output of indoor images from the SCAMP-5 system itself. We show that our algorithm is comparable to RGB systems in terms of precision as well as the fact that our system is highly flexible in terms of training images. Details can be found in the report while some key simulations can be performed on the Jupyter Notebook.
