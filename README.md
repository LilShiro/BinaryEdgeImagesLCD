## Loop Closure Detection for Binary Edge Images
This is a project which aims to do loop closure detection using only binary edge images as a source of input. Loop Closure Detection is the ability for a system to identify if it has revisited the same scene given a sequence of image inputs into the system. This project shows how we succesfully
